# DirtDiggerBot(!FindTheDirt) bot

This is a poorly written Reddit bot which takes advantage of the PRAW library. 

The goal of this bot is to find some 'dirt' on the mentioned user.

This bot was written in a couple hours for fun, so I would highly recommend not using. But you are welcome to if you want, the source code is here. 

## Requirements
You need to have Docker installed and you need a reddit account with dev access.

## How to use

1. Rename config.default to config.py and fill out the parameters.
2. From the project root directory, run `scripts/build.sh` to build the Docker image.
3. From the project root directory, run `scripts/run.sh` to start the container.
4. ??
5. Profit


## Warning
People don't like dirt being found out about them. I'm pretty sure my bot has been shadowbanned from a sub already... so that is something to look out for.
